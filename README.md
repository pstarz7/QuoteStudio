## 🚀 The "Vibe Coding" Story
This isn't just a project; it's a **fun experiment in Vibe Coding**. 
* **Built with Gemini:** Every line of logic and pixel of UI was co-created with Google Gemini.
* **Vibe First:** We prioritized the *feel* of the studio—monochrome tones, brutalist borders, and smooth interactions.
* **Speed & Flow:** Developed through rapid iterations to go from a simple canvas to a full-blown AI design lab.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI Wisdom Engine
Don't have a quote? No problem. The built-in AI engine generates **5 high-quality, human-feeling quotes** based on your **Mood** (e.g., Lonely, Inspired) and **Category** (Philosophical, Stoic, Romantic, etc.).

### 🖼️ Frame Geometry Lab
Switch instantly between **8 dynamic layouts**:
* **Classic Polaroid (4:5)** & **Instagram Story (9:16)**.
* **Wide Frames** for cinematic rectangular photography.
* **Tall & Reverse Polaroids** for varied text placement.
* **Solid Canvas Mode** for pure minimalist typography.

### ✍️ Pro Typography Suite
* **10+ Curated Fonts:** From grit-typewriters to elegant serifs and handwritten pencils.
* **Drag & Drop:** Move your quote anywhere on the high-res canvas with mouse or touch.
* **Pro Styling:** Real-time Bold, Italic, Line-Height, and Kerning adjustments.

### 🎭 Visual Processing
* **Studio Filters:** Apply Noir, Vintage, Vivid, or B&W presets.
* **Luminance & Depth:** Fine-tune brightness and blur to make text pop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
